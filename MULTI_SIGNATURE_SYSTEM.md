# Multi-Signature Approval System

## Implementation Overview ✅

### Smart Contract Integration
- Added `creatorApproved` and `platformApproved` flags to Raffle struct
- Both approvals required before any payout
- Automatic payout release when both parties approve

### Approval Process Flow

#### 1. Raffle Completion
```solidity
// Raffle ends, winner determined
// NO automatic payout - waits for approvals
emit RaffleEnded(raffleId, winner, prizeAmount);
```

#### 2. Mutual Approval Required
```solidity
function approveRaffleResult(uint256 _raffleId, bool _approve) external
```

**Who can approve:**
- `raffle.creator` → sets `creatorApproved`
- `raffle.winner` → sets `platformApproved` (winner approval)

#### 3. Automatic Payout Release
```solidity
// When BOTH approve → automatic payout
if (raffle.creatorApproved && raffle.platformApproved) {
    _releasePayout(_raffleId);
}
```

### Payout Types

#### USDT Only Raffles
- Both approve → Winner gets full USDT instantly

#### Physical Prize Raffles  
- Both approve → Enables claim process
- Winner then claims physical prize (30 days)
- If claimed → Creator gets USDT
- If not claimed → Winner gets 60% USDT, Platform gets 40%

### Backend Integration

#### Existing API Endpoints
- `POST /api/raffles/:id/approve-creator` (Creator approval)
- `POST /api/raffles/:id/approve-winner` (Winner approval) 
- Frontend: `MutualApprovalSystem.tsx` component

#### Database Fields
- `isApprovedByCreator` boolean
- `isApprovedByWinner` boolean

### Security Features

#### Contract Level
- Only creator and winner can approve
- Approvals required before any physical prize claim
- No payout without both approvals
- Reentrancy protection on all functions

#### Process Security
1. Raffle ends → Winner determined
2. Backend notifies both parties
3. Both must explicitly approve via UI
4. Contract automatically releases funds
5. For physical prizes → additional claim process

### Example Flow

#### Scenario: $100K House Raffle
1. **Raffle Ends:** Winner determined, no payout yet
2. **Creator Approval:** "I confirm winner is legitimate"
3. **Winner Approval:** "I accept this win result"
4. **Automatic Release:** Contract enables claim process
5. **Winner Claims:** "I can/cannot collect the house"
   - Can collect → Creator gets $100K USDT
   - Cannot collect → Winner gets $60K, Platform gets $40K

### Trust & Transparency
- All approvals recorded on blockchain
- Public verification of mutual consent
- Automated execution prevents manipulation
- Clear audit trail for all transactions
